The blade slices through its flesh with a sickening thud, drawing a pained screech from the creature. The goblin retaliates with a clumsy swing of its club, but Elena nimbly dodges, her movements fluid and graceful as she slips between the branches of the ancient trees. The goblin stumbles, momentarily stunned by its own failed attack.\n\nAs the goblin scrambles to regain its footing, Elena notices something peculiar. The creature clutches at its tattered cloak, revealing a **mysterious map** partially hidden beneath the rags. The map glows faintly in the dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy, casting an eerie light on the glowing flora around them. The map seems to hint at the location of a **lost kingdom**, long thought to be nothing more than a legend.\n\n> \"What do we have here?\" Elena murmurs to herself, her curiosity piqued as she carefully retrieves the map from the disoriented goblin. The air is thick with the scent of earth and the promise of untold secrets waiting to be uncovered.", "level": "info"}
